Hi, This script is for generating CSR and Private key.

Please enter your desired information according to the asked questions. All are mandatory.

The CSR and Private key files will be named after your domain name without the TLD and are stored in your desktop folder with the name domain-certificate

The default hashing algorithm is SHA256.

P.S. If you have execution policy in you system which you cannot execute the script, Use the .bat file to run the script. Before that edit the file location on .bat file.

Enjoy!
